# TeensyMouseJiggler

As simple as it sounds. This program, uploaded to a Teensy 3.0+, set to act as a USB Keyboard+Mouse+Joystick,
will move the mouse cursor one pixel, once a minute, for a total of 4 hours. After that the board needs to be reset
to restart the cycle. Ideally the small movement (one pixel up, one pixel back down) will not
interfere with normal user actions. 

The onboard LED will flash briefly after each movement while the program is running.
